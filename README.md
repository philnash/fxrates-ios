# fxrates

A currency exchange rate calculator for iOS, written in Swift.

Based on the existing website [http://fxrat.es](http://fxrat.es), this app is intended to be used by holiday makers who don't need the most up to date exchange rates, but do want an application that can easily tell them how much something is worth in their own currency. It won't necessarily use the network, therefore will work offline and display how old the data is.
